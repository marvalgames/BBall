<P>and steadily decline afterwards.</P>

<P>Talent - stronger effect on scoring categories</P>

<P>Skill - stronger effect on passing and rebounding</P>

<P>Intangibles - players work ethic and desire effecting individual and team performance. These players usually reach their prime later than most players.</P>
