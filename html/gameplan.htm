<P><b>GAME PLAN COMMAND</b></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>DEPTH CHART</P>

<P>Use this command to set the rotation/depth charts for all teams in the current league.</P>

<P>You can also set the active rosters for each team.</P>

<P>When team substitution is controlled by computer coaches the computer will use these depth charts and the actual minutes played to distribute minutes and assign starters.</P>

<P>Select the team from the team list.</P>

<P>The current roster for that team appears. (Up to 14 players)</P>

<P>The name of each player and their primary position are listed</P>

<P>Under each of the five possible positions you can select from the following for each player:</P>

<P>no -  The player will only be used in an emergency</P>

<P>1st -    Starter</P>

<P>2nd -   Backup who will receive the majority of the minutes when the starter is not on the court</P>

<P>3rd -   3rd stringers usually will get some spot minutes off the bench each game</P>

<P>4th -  Usually plays infrequently</P>

<P>none -  Will be used only in emegency</P>

<P>Set <B>active</B> to no and the player will not be used at all.</P>

<P>The first twelve players only that are active are eligible to play. (If you set all 14 to active - yes, only the first 12 will be considered active)</P>

<P>If no depth charts are set the computer will  set them before each game using the players primary position and their ability  however setting them yourself allows greater control</P>

<P>Select <B>OK</B> to save changes including any changes made with the ratings editor</P>

<P>Select <B>Cancel </B>to cancel any changes made</P>

<p><b>GAME PLAN</b></p>
<p><b>min - minutes </b><font face="Arial">- select the preferred amount of 
minutes per game you wish to designate the player</font></p>
<p><b>of - offensive focus - </b>Players preferred spot on the floor on offense, 
which will increase the number of that type of shot available, example: If a 
player focuses on the Post, the player will take more post shots than usual</p>
<p><b>df - defensive focus - </b>Players preferred spot on the floor on defense, 
this will increase the defense in the selected area. If you put a player in the 
post his post defense will improve but it can affect the defense in other areas</p>
<p><b>oi - offensive intensity - </b>The higher the number the more the player 
will look to score, this can have an effect on the players ability to make 
players better, fatigue, and defense</p>
<p><b>di - defensive intensity - </b>The higher the number the more aggressive 
the&nbsp; player will be defensively, leading to more turnovers, but can impact 
the players defensive ratings, and lead to increased fouls</p>
<p><b>bh - ball handler - </b>The higher the number the more the player will 
look to run the offense, pass first and shoot second, but can impact the players 
ability to score overall</p>
