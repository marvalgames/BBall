<P><B>Calling plays on offense:</B></P>

<P>As the coach you call the play for the player of your choice.</P>

<P>Keep in mind that the players play and they may or may not be able to get the play off as designed. The more you go to a player the more difficult it becomes for your team to execute. Pick your spots and keep in mind that the better scorers can be called on and depended on more.</P>

<P><B>Highlight the position of the player you want to call the play for.</B></P>

<P>Auto - Let the players decide who should shoot.</P>

<P>PG - Point Guard       </P>

<P>SG - Shooting Guard  </P>

<P>SF - Small Forward    </P>

<P>PF - Power Forward   </P>

<P>C -   Center               </P>

<P><B>Highlight the type of shot you want to call on the play.</B></P>

<P><B>Three </B>- the player selected will look to get open for a three point attempt.</P>

<P>If no player was selected (Auto) the offense will look to force up a three. Usually you should save this for when you really need a three from your team to get back in the game. </P>

<P><B>Outside</B> - the player selected will look to get open for an outside shot.</P>

<P><B>Drive</B> - the player selected will look to drive to the basket.</P>

<P><B>Post</B> - the player selected will post up and look to score down low.</P>

<P><B>Auto</B> - let the players decide the best shot type.</P>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<P><B>Sim Speed Command </B></P>

<P>Used to set the play by play speed during computer simulated games.</P>

<P>Set the slider all the way to the left for a very slow setting and all the way to the right for a very fast setting. </P>

<P>Checking the No Play by Play check box turns off the text and allows an almost instant view of the final score.</P>

<P>The setting chosen will automatically be saved after exiting Jump Shot.</P>

<P>Select the team's button to view that team's currently active roster and lineup.</P>

<P>Highlight the player in the lineup you want to replace then double click the player on the roster you want to replace the highlighted player with. If the lineup doesn't change this is either because the player you tried to substitute is already in the game or has fouled out.</P>

<P>Checking either the <B>Computer Substitutes Visitor</B> or <B>Computer Substitutes Home</B> gives substitution control to the computer coach. The computer will use the team depth charts to decide who plays. Unchecking gives control back to the player.</P>
