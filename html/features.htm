<P><B>Jump Shot Basketball Features</B></P>

<P><B></B></P>

<P><B>Simulate any basketball season</B> - Past, present and future.</P>

<P><B>Free Agency</B> – Keep the franchise player on your team by offering the maximum salary. Go after another team’s player. Hopefully, you have enough money under the cap. If not try offering the player one of the league exceptions. But always keep in mind what is important to a player as far as signing those contracts. Yes, it’s usually money, but it may not be enough.</P>

<P><B>Proposals </B>– Don’t like your city’s attitude toward the team. Move them if you can. But you’d better have something to offer a new city. Is your arena falling apart? If you have the value and the resources perhaps you can get a new arena approved that might turn your team around. You can even add your own cities and arenas to the mix. </P>

<P><B>Team Finances</B> – Take control of revenues by setting prices throughout the arena and maximize profits. Why? More money to spend to go after the hot free agent you have an eye for. </P>

<P><B>Career Play</B> - Begin the dynasty. Players age, improve and decline at different rates. Draft that rookie you need to help put you over the top.</P>

<P><B>Staff Hiring Period</B>- Compete for Scouts, Coaches and General Managers that age, retire, resign, and switch teams</P>

<P><B>Control anywhere from 1 to 32 teams</B> -the computer coach handles the rest. 
Custom Leagues, schedules, even expand your franchise</P>

<P><B>Multi-player Trades</B> -  Select up to up to five players a side including draft picks or future draft picks. Accept trade proposals from a crafty computer GM. Each with their own strengths and weaknesses. 
Draft Day trades, place players on the block and more</P>

<P><B>Player editor </B> - Make all the changes you want or create brand new players. Heck create yourself. Hopefully you'll score more than Rodman. Or if you want, make Rodman a scorer. </P>

<P><B>League editor</B> - Design your own league complete with your own divisions and playoff format. A complete draft module allows you to compete with other GM's in hopes of putting together your dream team.</P>

<P><B>Complete Stats - </B>Includes unique stats you won't find anywhere else. Keep year by year stats of every player who has ever played. Featuring our exclusive true ratings that estimate a player’s true value to the team by the number of wins gained when in the lineup.  All players are also rated in four important offensive and defensive categories. Not sure how to rate them, then just hit the calculate button in the player editor, and the computer will estimate the ratings for you.</P>

<P><B>Realistic Results - </B>All the stats and ratings are combined to give your players and teams very realistic results. But be warned, try to take a player like Kerr off the 96-97 Bulls and notice how he struggles more without the benefit of teammates creating shots for him. 
Keep an eye on the players happiness level as that could make the difference in 
the quest for the dynasty</P>

<P><B>Make all the calls</B> - Go to your go to guy down the stretch or double team your opponent’s main player. Just be aware of your choices. Trying to double Duncan with Robinson on the court could mean a loss. Call a players number too much on offense and watch the shot opportunities dwindle</P>

<P><B>Substitutions</B> - Try and find a combination that works. Without enough scoring and passing in the lineup those open shots aren't so open any more as your team struggles for offense. Better make sure there are some good defenders out there too, to keep your opponent from scoring at will.</P>

<P><B>Depth charts</B> - Set them at each position and let your assistant computer coach handle the game substitutions. The computer will make sure your players get the minutes they deserve. With true substitution a player like Armstrong will get big minutes off the bench.</P>

<P><B>Save Game Results - </B>Save or print up to 10000 box-scores and play-by-play logs for every team in a league.</P>

<P><B>Auto Play Options </B>- Adjust the play-by-play speed to your viewing and coaching preferences. If you prefer turn off the play-by-play altogether and get results almost instantly.</P>

<P><B>Playoffs - </B>Defense goes up a notch, teams shorten their bench as they play for the ring. Complete stats and records are saved.</P>
