<P><B>Free Agency Period</B></P>

<P>Use this command to view player free agent status &amp; requests.  During the off-season this command is used to sign free agents during the free agency period.</P>

<P><B>Free Agency Salary Rules:</B></P>

<P>Every team has a soft cap. The cap salaries of all players can total no more 
than that amount in any season. Soft Caps allow teams to go over the cap limit by using salary cap exceptions.</P>

<P>Note: adjust the soft cap from <a href="setupsettings.htm">Franchise Settings
</a></P>

<P><B>Salary Cap Exceptions:</B>

<OL>
	<LI>First round draft pick rookies are automatically signed to contracts defined by the rookie salary scale with the 1<SUP>st</SUP> 
    overall pick in round 1 having the largest salary. The scale changes 
    depending upon the number of teams in the league. Second round picks receive 
    2 year contracts</LI>

	<LI>Each year a team can sign a player to a <B>minimum exception</B>.  The minimum exception is a 1 year contract at 1.1 million.</LI>

	<LI>Each year a team can sign a player to a <B>midlevel exception</B>. This 
    midlevel exception is a 1 year contract at 4.5 million.</LI>

	<LI>Teams can sign players to league <B>minimum contracts</B>.  The minimum is determined by a players years of service.  Players with 10 or more years of service can sign for 1 million dollars.</LI>

	<LI>Teams can use the <B>Bird Rule Exception</B> on Players with Bird Rights. This rule allows teams to go over the cap to sign the free agents on their own teams. Players eligible for Bird Rights  have not left one team to sign with another team during the last 3 years.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Other Rules:</B>

<OL>
	<LI>Contracts can not exceed 6 years<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Raises can not exceed 10% for players without Bird rights<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Raises can not exceed 15% for players with Bird rights<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Contracts must not exceed the <B>maximum salary</B> in the first year of a contract.  The maximum is determined by years of service.  Players with 10 or more years of service can receive a 14 million maximum. </LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Owner Salary Cap</B> – The salaries of all players on a team cannot total more than the owner salary cap in any season.  The owner’s cap is determined by both a team’s current value and the owners spending rating (hidden).  The cap changes each year based on the success of the team and profit of the team.  It is possible for the owners cap to be less that 
soft cap amount. You can exceed the owner cap by offering minimum contracts only. To disable the owner cap restrictions turn off finances from the
<a href="setupsettings.htm">Franchise Settings Button</a></P>

<P><B>Explanation of Free Agency Period</B> – Free agency period occurs between the 
<A HREF="draftpreview.htm">Rookie Draft</A> and <A HREF="progresscamp.htm">Training Camp</A>.  You can view this screen any other time but you will not be able to offer contracts.</P>

<P><B>Each stage allows teams to offer players a contract as long as the total 
of the offered salaries adhere to the cap rules. Example:&nbsp; </B>You are 20 
million under the cap and then offer 2 players, 10 million dollars a season, 
bringing you to the cap amount. You can no longer offer contracts to any more 
players unless the rules allow you to go over the cap. In this case you may have 
players with bird rights and then you could offer those players money and exceed 
the cap, also if you have an exception available you can still offer one player 
the exception amount (not more than one because both players can not sign). You 
can always offer players the minimum amounts. Also the number of offers is 
limited to the amount of roster slots available, offers exceeding this amount 
will be ignored when the requests are processed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;Highlight the player that you wish to offer a contract to, then highlight the team that is negotiating.  The team must be set to player.  Then select the <B>Negotiate Contract Button</B> to arrange your offer.</P>

<P>By clicking <B>Ok</B> from the <A HREF="offercontract.htm">Negotiate Screen</A> you will submit an offer that will be listed in the offers box.  To override the offer, simply select a new player and repeat the above listed process.</P>

<P>Signings will be listed in the Signings Box.  </P>

<P>Subsequent rounds follow the same procedure except the <B>Begin Free Agency Period Button</B> is now the <B>Continue Free Agency Period Button</B>.  </P>

<P>The negotiate contract button will be disabled for computer teams and for  currently signed players.  </P>

<P><B>Complete Free Agency Period button</B> – Click when player controlled teams are finished with negotiations. Computer teams will continue to bid on players as necessary</P>

<P>The <B>Complete Free Agency Period button</B> will also be enabled when all computer controlled teams have filled the rosters to their satisfaction.  Click to complete the free agency period.</P>
