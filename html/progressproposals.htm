<P><b>ARENA PROPOSALS</b></P>

<P>Use this command in the offseason when prompted by the main screen.</P>

<P>This command is not available when finances is turned off.</P>

<P>This command is required for arena aging and allows movement of franchise and construction of new arenas for franchises.</P>

<P>The higher the quality of an arena the more cash flow your team generates, thereby increasing your teams chances of obtaining key players because of both franchise prestige and money available.</P>

<P>Follow the steps below to attempt to move to a new city or construct an arena.</P>

<P>Note: When proposing a city move you are required to submit an arena construction proposal as well.</P>

<P>Select a city to propose a move to. If staying in the same city highlight that teams current city. If the team in control is player controlled and the city is currently not occupied by another team  and the last accepted proposal was more than 10 years ago the<B> Submit Proposal Button </B>will be activated.</P>

<P>If the 10 year period has not passed the display will note that to you</P>

<P>Edit the arena data as necessary. The construction cost will be automatically adjusted as you tab or click from one box to the next.</P>

<P>To adjust the team cost you can edit the public contribution number. The contribution reflects the amount you want the city to spend in assisting with arena construction. The figure can range from 51-100% of the total cost.</P>

<P>The cost of the arena is impacted by the values entered.</P>

<P>Suites are very expensive but impact revenue very positively.</P>

<P>Club Seats also generate cost with the benefit of revenue.</P>

<P>Capacity generates the most consistent revenue.</P>

<P>When satisfied with the results Click the <B>Submit Proposals Button</B>.</P>

<P>The display will inform you if the proposal will be considered by the city.</P>

<P>When this is completed for all player controlled teams, click the <B>View Final City Decisions Button</B>.</P>

<P>The display will list all computer and player teams who have had the proposal approved.</P>

<P>The time of construction is automatically determined by the city and ranges from 3 to 5 years. The team cost will be spread out to each of the years evenly. </P>

<P>The costs are based on 82 game seasons but will be added to expenses on a per game basis</P>

<P>Example: </P>

<P>You are playing in a 41 game season and the team cost is 72 million</P>

<P>Since the cost is based on a 82 game season and your season is half of that the cost of the arena will be half as well, for a total of 36 million.</P>

<P>If construction time was determined as four years the additional arena expenses in addition to basic arena expenses will be 9 million.</P>

<P>The Final decisions are based primarily on the following.

<OL>
	<LI>The current value of the team<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>The success of the franchise<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Political support<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Amount of money you request the city to spend.</LI>
</OL>

<P>The better the attributes of the city the more reluctant the city can be to accept.</P>

<P>Click OK to save the changes.</P>

<P>Clicking OK will also allow the arenas to age.</P>

<P>If you are playing with finances on but do not wish to submit a proposal just click OK and continue to the next stage</P>
