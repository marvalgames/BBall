<P>Use this command to end the current season at any time and begin the off season.</P>

<P>The current year will be increased by one year and all player’s ages will be increased by one. Player ratings will change based on the quality of the coaches development ratings, career projections and prime age.</P>

<P><B>Career Play Projections:</B></P>

<P>These projections effect the development curve of players.</P>

<P>The ratings are randomly created and are reported differently based on the scout.</P>

<P>The players tend to improve until they reach their random prime year (usually 27-29)</P>

<P>and steadily decline afterwards.</P>

<P>Talent - stronger effect on scoring categories</P>

<P>Skill - stronger effect on passing and rebounding</P>

<P>Intangibles - players work ethic and desire effecting individual and team performance. These players usually reach their prime later than most players.</P>

<P>Use these projections as a strong guideline only. Certain players will surprise even the best scouts so keep an eye on the stats.</P>

<P>The current season stats will be saved to the player’s career stats totals.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="draftpreview.htm">Rookie Draft Command</A> will then be available and becomes the usual next step before beginning play next season.</P>
