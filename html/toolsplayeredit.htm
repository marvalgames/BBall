<P>Each team contains 15 slots.  This is where you can select any player from a particular team to edit by simply changing that player's number.  Next to each of the abbreviations you will see a box where you can enter the stats.   These stats are similar to the stats that can be found in any newspaper boxscore.  Simply click on the desired box and either enter or change a value. The tab key will allow you to easily move from one stat. to the next.   The following is a list of the abbreviations and their meanings:</P>

<P><B>DEPTH CHART </B>– This feature allows you to choose the starters and backups at all 5 positions.   These depth charts will be used when you have a team to be coached by the computer.  1st - designates a starter (1st string) at that position.  2nd - means the player is used most often by the computer in its substitutions.  If a team has more then one of the same at a position, the computer will then decide who should play based on a player’s minutes and ratings.  When set to ok , a player can be used occasionaly at that position but is not really a set part of the rotation.  The following is a list of abbreviations and their meanings:</P>

<P>PG – Point guard</P>

<P>SG – Shooting guard</P>

<P>SF – Small forward</P>

<P>PF – Power forward</P>

<P>C – Center</P>

<P><B>ACTIVE </B>– When this section is checked it means that the player is on the active roster for the next game.  If this section is unchecked it means that the player is ineligible.  The first 12 players of a particular team that are checked as active make up the protected list.</P>

<P><B>Consistent </B>(1-3) - Better consistency is three. These players performance will not waver as much from game to game.</P>

<P>Once you have completed entering data for a player, you can then click Calculate and the computer will then attempt to rate players from a scale of 1-9 in 4 offensive and defensive categories.  These categories are as follows with the alternate abbreviation in parenthesis:</P>

<P><B>OUTSIDE OFFENSE(O)</B> – Usually excellent jump shooters.  These players fight through screens, move without the ball and in some cases their height allows them to shoot over people</P>

<P><B>DRIVING OFFENSE(D)</B> – Ability to both dribble and drive for scoring tries.  Point guards usually are the  best at this.</P>
