<P><B>&nbsp;Training Camp Command</B></P>

<P>Use this command to determine your  roster before season play.</P>

<P>This command is only available after a <A HREF="draftpreview.htm">Rookie Draft</A> has occurred.</P>

<P>To release a player from a player controlled team, select a player and click the <B>Release Player Button</B>.</P>

<P>View a <A HREF="playercard.htm">Player Report</A> by double clicking the selected player.</P>

<P>Click on the <B>Column Headers</B> to sort the players on a particular team by categories.</P>

<P>Note: The ratings are based on the COACHES ability to evaluate a player.</P>

<P>If any players have retired they will be displayed under the Set Computer Teams Button.</P>

<P>On rare occasions a player will retire prematurely because of personal circumstances.</P>

<P>Some players will no longer be available because their poor play did not warrant an invite to training camp.</P>

<P>Click the <B>Set Computer Teams Button</B> after releasing any unwanted players.</P>

<P>The computer coaches based on their evaluation of a player will set the rosters for simulate controlled teams. </P>

<P>The computer also uses a <B>project rating </B>to decide to keep a player based on potential and age  or to go with an established player regardless of age.</P>

<P>Immediately after this the <B>Hall of Fame Selections Button</B> will be enabled.  Click this button to determine if any players will be entering the <A HREF="historyhof.htm">Hall of Fame</A>.</P>

<P>Now you can click the <B>End Training Camp Button</B> to save the rosters to be used for the next season.</P>

<P>Retirements are random and fairly rare. Better players tend to retire rather than play too long. Occasionally a player will unexpectedly retire before their prime</P>

<P>Use the <B>Cancel Training Camp Button</B> if you don’t like what just happened or who retired. (Cheat)</P>

<P>Use the <B>Progress Button</B> to see how the player rating have changed 
compared to last season</P>
