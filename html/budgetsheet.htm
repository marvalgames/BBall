<P><B><U>City Attributes (1-low, 5-high)</U></B></P>

<P><B>Fan</B> – Fan support (affects primarily attendance)</P>

<P><B>Pop</B> – Population base of city &amp; arena (affects primarily attendance)</P>

<P><B>Int</B> – Interest in team (affects primarily radio &amp; TV revenue)</P>

<P><B>Comp</B> – Competition for audience in the area</P>

<P><B>Eco</B> – Economy, the better the economy the more money fans will spend and the higher the likelihood of selling higher priced seats</P>

<P><B>Cost</B> – General cost of living (higher cost of living in relation to pricing will increase or decrease the impact prices make)</P>

<P><B>Pol</B> – Political support (very important when proposing new arenas)</P>

<P>All attributes of a city should be considered when setting ticket prices in addition to your evaluation of a team.  For example, a strong economy &amp; a good team should allow one to set prices a little higher than normal but poor fan support can offset this.  It is up to the player to determine the impact of all factors in determining a means to maximize profit and thereby allowing one to spend more money during the all important free agency period.  City attributes can change each year based on the results financially &amp; on the court the previous season.</P>
