<P><B>Jump Shot Basketball Career Play</B></P>

<P>Career Play Procedures</P>

<P>Jump Shot is designed for play in two different ways.</P>

<P>As a single season replay or as a fictional league using the current players or randomly created fictional players that are eventually replaced by fictional players.</P>

<P>You can simulate a season before selecting any options from the career menu.</P>

<P>When you have completed and are ready to start the next season then click the
<a href="progressend.htm">End Season Button</a> </P>

<P>All players will age and their ratings will change based on random factors like their prime age, their actual age, the coaches development ratings and the career projections.</P>

<P>Before continuing, now is the time to make changes to your staff and allow all teams to do the same by selecting <U>&nbsp;Staff 
H<a href="staffs.htm">Staff Hiring Period</a>iring</U></P>

<P>Once the players have aged and next years staffs are set then you can click the <A HREF="draftpreview.htm">Rookie Draft Button</A> to conduct a draft of amateur players. The draft consists of two rounds.</P>

<P>Special Note: fictional player names for the rookie draft are generated using two files </P>

<P>fnames.txt - first names</P>

<P>lnames.txt - last names</P>

<P>They can be edited and names can be added.</P>

<P>Just make sure - only one name per line.</P>

<P>The following options will now become available from the Finances Menu</P>

<P><A HREF="freeagency.htm">Free Agency</A> allows you to offer contracts to any unsigned player</P>

<P><A HREF="budgetsheet.htm">Budget Sheet </A>allows setting of all the Arena Prices</P>

<P><A HREF="progressproposals.htm">Proposals </A>will allow you to propose a move to a new city complete with a new arena or request a new arena in the current city</P>

<P>Immediately after the <A HREF="progresscamp.htm">Training Camp Button</A> will be 
viewable. This screen allows you to finalize the rosters of teams after the draft and find out if players have retired or have been elected to the Hall of Fame.</P>

<P>You are then ready to begin the next season.</P>
