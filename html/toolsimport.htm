<P><b>LEAGUE IMPORT</b></P>

<P>Use this command to import league created with the .csv format</P>

<P>Using a default league (recommended) - click New League<br>
<br>
Select a name for your league in the New League Name Box<br>
<br>
If the league you are importing contains a different number of teams than the 
default league you are using remember to delete or add the teams. <br>
<br>
Set Import Player Data File to on<br>
<br>
Click Ok<br>
The Import Player Data From File Box will appear<br>
<br>
The player data file must be saved as .csv. The preferred way is via a program 
like Excel. This way you can set up the players using a spreadsheet.<br>
For an example of what a .csv file looks like just open up one of our Rookie 
Files in notepad.<br>
<br>
The first row is the heading names for each column<br>
Each row in the .csv files represents a player.<br>
The order of the cells in a spreadsheet (or just the values of the .csv) must be 
exact to import properly<br>
The order of the cells are listed in the Import Player Data From File Box<br>
<br>
The Standard File Format is the most commonly used<br>
Column 1 - Name<br>
Column 2 - Team Name<br>
Column 3 - Pos (pg,sg,sf,pf,c)<br>
Column 4 - Games<br>
Column 5 - Minutes<br>
Column 6 - Field Goals Made<br>
Column 7 - Field Goals Attempted<br>
Column 8 - Free Throws Made<br>
Column 9 - Free Throws Attempted<br>
Column 10- Threes Made<br>
Column 11- Threes Attempted<br>
Column 12- Offensive Rebounds<br>
Column 13- Total Rebounds<br>
Column 14- Assists<br>
Column 15- Steals<br>
Column 16- Turnovers<br>
Column 17- Blocks<br>
Column 18- Personal Fouls<br>
Column 19- Player Age<br>
Column 20- Years Pro<br>
Column 21- Bird Years<br>
Column 22-27 Year 1 thru Year 6 contract value (1400 would represent 14 million)<br>
<br>
Column 19-20 is required only when &quot;Ages Only&quot; is selected in the File Data 
Includes Option<br>
Column 19-27 is required only when &quot;Ages and Contracts&quot; is selected in the File 
Data Includes Option<br>
The columns that are not used are randomly generated but columns 1-17 are 
required<br>
<br>
If the Team Name Column does not match the team name of your new league you can 
use the Change Abbreviation Button To insure they match. <br>
For Example if your league has the Celtics and your data file Team Name Column 
uses bos you would select the Celtics from the Team Abbreviation drop down box 
then change the edit box beneath to bos and then click Change Abbreviation. The 
first 14 players in the data file that have bos in the Team Name column would 
then be imported to the Celtics.<br>
<br>
The first 96 players without abbreviations or that are not among the first 14 
listed for a particular team are added to the Free Agent Pool<br>
<br>
<br>
If your abbreviations and your data file are properly set up use the Select File 
to Import Button to load your custom .csv file<br>
<br>
The Player Data File Import Completed prompt will appear <br>
Click Ok then Exit the Import Box.<br>
The files of your new league will then be created and ready to be used</P>
