HOW TO USE THE OPTIONAL LEAGUE IMPORT TOOL WHEN CREATING LEAGUES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using a default league (recommended) - click New League

Select a name for your league in the New League Name Box

If the league you are importing contains a different number of teams than the default league you are using and you are not selecting the Draft League option then please delete or add the correct teams. 

Set Import Player Data File to on

Click Create
The Import Player Data From File Box will appear

The player data file must be saved as .csv. The preferred way is via a program like Excel. This way you can set up the players using a spreadsheet.
For an example of what a .csv file looks like just open up one of our Rookie Files in notepad.

The first row is the heading names for each column
Each row in the .csv files represents a player.
The order of the cells in a spreadsheet (or just the values of the .csv) must be exact to import properly
